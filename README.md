# Homework #2

## Instructions
---
1. Feynman Writing Prompts - Write out explanations of the following concepts like you are explaining it to a 12 year old.  Doing this will help you quickly discover any holes in your understanding.  Ask your questions on Slack.
Lesson 1 writing prompts.


Variables 
Strings 
Functions (arguments, return) 
if statements 
Boolean values (true, false) 

Variables - Just like in pre-Algebra variables represent and give you a way to refer to data.  Only with Javascript those variables can be just about anything. 

Strings - Strings are a type of variable that hold alphanumeric data.

Functions - Functions hold a group of data (variables and expressions etc) and allow you to easily refer to said data.

If statements tell your script what do to do based on whether or not a statement is true.

Boolean values are simply true or false.  Boolean variables can be used, among other things, to return whether or not a statement is true or false.


<b>Lesson 2 writing prompts.</b>

for 
&&, ||, ! 
Arrays 
Git 
GitHub 

<b>for</b> loops cause the same bit of code to be ran, until the statement is false

<b>&&,||, !</b>  are all logic operators that allow you to determine logic. In if statements && can be used to allow the block of code in the statement to be ran if more than one statement is true.  Where || means or and can be used to allow a block of code to run if at least one of the statements meets the criteria.  ! simply means not this. ie !0 not zero.  It can be used to check if a variable or statement does not equal the data supplied.

<b>Arrays</b> allow you to store many values within one variable.

<b>Git</b> is a version control system that allows programmers to see the changes they and their team have made and allows you to easily revert back to previous code or restore your code after a computer failure or other mishap.

<b>GitHub</b> is a free to use Git, as long as you do not mind your code being publicly searchable.


2. Install git.  https://git-scm.com/downloads
